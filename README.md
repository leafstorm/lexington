Lexington
=========
Lexington is a nonblocking lexer toolkit for Python. It's inspired by
[a similar lexing toolkit][might] written in Scala by Matt Might. Basically,
it allows you to define lexers in Python, and then stream input to them
asynchronously.

It's built on top of a regular expression implementation that allows for
easy introspection and composition, by building regular expressions out of
Python objects.

Oh, and it's named after Lexington, North Carolina, not any of the other
Lexingtons lying around.
